    <h2>Trial Issues</h2>
    <p>
      Launched in 2003 at the completion of the first stage of digitization, the Nuremberg Trials
      Project presented documents from and relating to the Medical Case, which was Case 1 of the
      NMT trials. The Medical Case (U.S.A. v. Karl Brandt et al., also known as the Doctors' Trial)
      was held in 1946-1947 and involved 23 defendants accused of organizing and participating in
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in the form of harmful or fatal medical experiments
      and other medical procedures inflicted on both civilians and prisoners of war.

      <h3> Trial Documents </h3>
      <p>
        Trial documents, or case file documents, are briefs, transcripts of oral arguments,
        document books of evidence exhibits, and other documents that were used in the course
        of the trial (or, in a few cases, prepared for use but not finally used in the trial). The
        bulk of the trial documents are the briefs presented by the defense and prosecution
        for and against each defendant, and the document books containing texts of the
        written evidence presented as exhibits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prosecution document books are organized by subject (e.g., euthanasia or the sterilization
        experiments in Case 1), while the defense document books are organized by individual
        defendants (e.g., Dr. Becker-Freyseng). This difference reflects the way the two sides
        presented their cases: The prosecution presented evidence about the various crimes in
        succession, citing the various defendants charged with responsibility for each one (e.g.,
        the defendants implicated in the freezing experiments), and each defendant presented a
        separate case concerning the charges he or she faced (e.g., the several charges against
        Viktor Brack).
      </p>

      <p>
        Nearly all of the prosecution exhibits, and many of the defense exhibits, were derived
        from material in the Evidence Files (see following section).
