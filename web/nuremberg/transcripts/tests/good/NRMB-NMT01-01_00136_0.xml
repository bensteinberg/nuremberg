  <p><spkr>THE MARSHAL:</spkr> The Military Tribunal is again in session.</p>
  <p><spkr>MR. MCHANEY:</spkr> We have completed our presentation as to the defendants that were active within the frame-work of the Luftwaffe. And, next, we can consider the positions held by the defendants in the block within the framework of the SS, an organization which was found to be criminal by The International Military Tribunal.</p>
  <p>The defendants Karl Brandt, Genzken, Gebhardt, Rudolf Brandt, ********* Helmut Poppendick, Viktor Brack, Hoven and Fritz Fischer, were all member of the SS after 1 September 1939, and are so charged in Count 4 of the Indictment.</p>
  <p>We have already become familiar with the position of Karl Brandt. Before turning to the careers of the other SS defendants, I think it would be helpful for the Tribunal to present in evidence the charts showing the medical organization of the SS.</p>
  <p>The next document is <evidenceFileDoc n="NO-416">NO-416</evidenceFileDoc>, which will be Prosecution Exhibit No. <exhibitDocPros n="22">22</exhibitDocPros>, and it carries the organization of the SS prior to 31 August 1943.</p>
  <p>The second chart is Document <evidenceFileDoc n="NO-417">NO-417</evidenceFileDoc>, which will be Prosecution Exhibit No. 23, and it covers the medical organization of the SS after the 31st of August 1943.</p>
  <p>Both of these charts were signed by the defendant Mrugowsky. We had again hoped to have these charts reproduced in larger scale for use in the Courtroom, but that has proved impossible.</p>
  <p>Of course, the whole of the SS, including the Medical Department was under the Command of Reichsfuehrer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. The relation of Karl Brandt and Handloser to the Medical Service of the SS, by virtue of their positions as Reichminister of the Health and Sanitation and Chief of the Medical Services of the Wehrmacht are shown in these charts.
